# AmigaScicalc
Scientific Calculator for AmigaOS classic

I originally wrote this Scientific Calculator utility as part of my
computing studies back in 1996 and always intended to release it to
Aminet, but never quite got around to it.

I designed it to be a scientific version of the AmigaOS 3.1 built in
calculator. Thus it has the following features:
* Font sensitive GUI, style guide compliant
* Clipboard support
* Tape window
* Uses math* libraries for most functions

Plus some extra features
* Scientific functions (of course) including ability to work in and convert
hex and binary
* AmigaGuide help
* Multiple memory registers

Released on Aminet in 2003, I'm releasing it again on GitHub under an MIT license. I welcome anyone who wants to
pick it up, and especially anyone who wants to fix the bugs (notably in
the combination and permutation functions) and upgrade it to OS3.9
features, including
* Reaction GUI
* locale support
* Arexx port
* Commodity support
* New icons
